Prior research often relies on a single visual encoder for both tasks,\nsuch as Chameleon. However, due to the differing levels of information granularity required by\nmultimodal understanding and generation, this approach can lead to suboptimal performance,\nparticularly in multimodal understanding. To address this issue, we decouple visual encoding\ninto separate pathways, while still leveraging a single, unified transformer architecture for\nprocessing. The decoupling not only alleviates the conflict between the visual encoder’s roles in\nunderstanding and generation, but also enhances the framework’s flexibility. For instance, both\nthe multimodal understanding and generation components can independently select their most\nsuitable encoding methods.

            " Janus: Decoupling Visual Encoding for Unified\nMultimodal Understanding and Generation\nChengyue Wu1,2Xiaokang Chen1,∗,†Zhiyu Wu1,3Yiyang Ma1,3Xingchao Liu1Zizheng Pan1\nWen Liu1Zhenda Xie1Xingkai Yu1Chong Ruan1Ping Luo2,∗\n1DeepSeek-AI2The University of Hong Kong3Peking University\n†: Project lead∗: Corresponding authors\nProject Page: https:\/\/github.com\/deepseek-ai\/Janus\nAbstract\nIn this paper, we introduce Janus , an autoregressive framework that unifies multimodal under-\nstanding and generation. Prior research often relies on a single visual encoder for both tasks,\nsuch as Chameleon. However, due to the differing levels of information granularity required by\nmultimodal understanding and generation, this approach can lead to suboptimal performance,\nparticularly in multimodal understanding. To address this issue, we decouple visual encoding\ninto separate pathways, while still leveraging a single, unified transformer architecture for\nprocessing. The decoupling not only alleviates the conflict between the visual encoder’s roles in\nunderstanding and generation, but also enhances the framework’s flexibility. For instance, both\nthe multimodal understanding and generation components can independently select their most\nsuitable encoding methods. Experiments show that Janus surpasses previous unified model\nand matches or exceeds the performance of task-specific models. The simplicity, high flexibility, ",

Scaling reinforcement learning (RL) unlocks a new\naxis for the continued improvement of artificial intelligence, with the promise that large language\nmodels (LLMs) can scale their training data by learning to explore with rewards. However, prior\npublished work has not produced competitive results. In light of this, we report on the training practice\nof Kimi k1.5, our latest multi-modal LLM trained with RL, including its RL training techniques,\nmulti-modal data recipes, and infrastructure optimization. Long context scaling and improved policy\noptimization methods are key ingredients of our approach, which establishes a simplistic, effective\nRL framework without relying on more complex techniques such as Monte Carlo tree search, value\nfunctions, and process reward models. Notably, our system achieves state-of-the-art reasoning\nperformance across multiple benchmarks and modalities—e.g., 77.5 on AIME, 96.2 on MATH\n500, 94-th percentile on Codeforces, 74.9 on MathVista—matching OpenAI’s o1.

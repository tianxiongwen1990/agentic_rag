            " Kimi k1.5 TECHNICAL REPORT\n2.6.1 Large Scale Reinforcement Learning Training System for LLM\nIn the realm of artificial intelligence, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a pivotal training methodology\nfor large language models (LLMs)(Ouyang et al. 2022)(Jaech et al. 2024), drawing inspiration from its success in\nmastering complex games like Go, StarCraft II, and Dota 2 through systems such as AlphaGo(Silver et al. 2017),\nAlphaStar(Vinyals et al. 2019), and OpenAI Dota Five (Berner et al. 2019). Following in this tradition, the Kimi\nk1.5 system adopts an iterative synchronous RL framework, meticulously designed to bolster the model’s reasoning\ncapabilities through persistent learning and adaptation. A key innovation in this system is the introduction of a Partial\nRollout technique, designed to optimize the handling of complex reasoning trajectories.\nThe RL training system as illustrated in Figure 3a operates through an iterative synchronous approach, with each\niteration encompassing a rollout phase and a training phase. During the rollout phase, rollout workers, coordinated\nby a central master, generate rollout trajectories by interacting with the model, producing sequences of responses to\nvarious inputs. These trajectories are then stored in a replay buffer, which ensures a diverse and unbiased dataset for\ntraining by disrupting temporal correlations. In the subsequent training phase, trainer workers access these experiences"

Second, while distillation\nstrategies are both economical and effective, advancing beyond the boundaries of intelligence\nmay still require more powerful base models and larger-scale reinforcement learning.\n4.2.
